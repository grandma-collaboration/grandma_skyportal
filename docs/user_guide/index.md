## Creating your IAM Account and login to SkyPortal

Step 1. We won't access SkyPortal but IAM's [login page](https://iam-grandma.ijclab.in2p3.fr) to create your account.
First, choose the method of your choice: Slack or EDUGain.
*If you are not able to use one of these methods to authenticate, please contact us to discuss alternatives.*

If you choose to create your IAM Account using Slack, you might be asked for your workspace name.
If that's the case, use `granmagroupe` as workspace name. If you use eduGAIN, you need to select
your home institution: you can enter some letters from its name to filter the long list...

Step 2. A form will be displayed: enter your `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` and `username`.
Also, you'll notice a `note` field. We request you to put your affiliation in this note, as well as other information
you may find useful. It is mandatory ! Upon submitting the form, a message will appear confirming that you applied for an account.

Step 3. You will receive an email, asking you to validate your email, with a confirmation link.
Please click the link: accounts will not be validated until you confirmed your email.
**Your account won't be verified by an administrator until you do it.** Once it is done, wait
for your account to be validated by an administrator: once it is done you'll receive a new email
that also contains a link to set your IAM password: **just ignore it** as you will not need it
to access Icare with Slack or eduGAIN.

Step 4. Now that your account as been verified, go to [https://grandma-v2.ijclab.in2p3.fr/](https://grandma-v2.ijclab.in2p3.fr/)
and click on `Sign in with IAM` button. Then choose the same authentication method you chose before (Slack or EDUGain).

If you want to enable other authentication methods for your account, look at the

Step 5. Done !!! You will be redirected to your SkyPortal profile. By default, you should have the
